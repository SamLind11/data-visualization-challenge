# data-visualization-challenge

## Description

This repository contains work for the data visualization challenge for the UNC Data Analytics Bootcamp.  The centerpiece of the project is a Jupyter Notebook file which reads in data from two csv files containing raw data for a cancer study performed on mice using a variety of drug regimens.  The two files are converted into DataFrames, which are then merged into a single frame.  Simple data cleaning is performed to remove duplicate values and summary statistics were found using methods from Pandas.

Several bar plots, pie charts, boxplots, line graphs, and scatter plots were generated using both Pandas and PyPlot.  A description of observations and findings is included at the start of the file.

## Contributors

The starter code for the Jupyter Notebook was provided by the UNC Bootcamp.  Additionally, some lines of code for creating the linear regression model were adapted from resources provided from the bootcamp.  All other code for working with Dataframes and generating data visuals was written by Sam Lind.
